# About
Glirt: GPU-accelerated Linear Image Registration Toolkirt   
This tool is a part of my master's thesis project several years ago (2008-2009), it's written in CUDA and C++   
It's a GPU implementation of the classicial linear image registeration tool `FLIRT`, with more than 10x performance enhancement   

# Feature
* Register two 3D medical images (i.e. CT images) linearly
* Ultra-fast

# Build
Visual Studio 2008 or newer   
Go to `src` folder and open `glirt.sln`, then build

# License
BSD
